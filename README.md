# clj-bean

The better way to create JavaBeans from Clojure.

A tiny library to create standards compliant JavaBeans with good performance.
Supports primitive types and has the API you always wanted.

## Usage

```clojure
(defbean your.java.package.MyBean
  [[long timestamp]
   [String channel]
   [String title]
   [String diffUrl]
   [String user]
   [long byteDiff]
   [String summary]
   [boolean isMinor]
   [boolean isNew]
   [boolean isUnpatrolled]
   [boolean isBotEdit]
   [boolean isSpecial]
   [boolean isTalk]])
```

Note that you need to use an [AOT-compiled namespace](https://clojure.org/reference/compilation)
with `defbean` to generate the necessary Java class files.
